####Description
There are two data files in the package: positive.review and negative.review. They correspond to
positive and negative book reviews. The text has been preprocessed so that each line contains a review
document; each token (e.g., year:2) represents a word and its frequency in the document. The last token
(e.g., #label#:negative) in each line indicates the polarity (label) of the document.  
**On executing the run classifier.py , it will return the following results:**  
Accuracy
on training set: 0.972500, on test set: 0.835000
